pokemon sprites in a box!

- this is really the silliest thing i've made so far
- it started out as a testing ground for my gif animator class

- it doesn't do anything fancy, other than gather up all the gifs in the "pokes" folder, randomly pick one, and show it to you
- there is a refresh button if you want it to pick again
- the window defaults to the top left hand corner of the screen, but can be moved around by clicking and dragging the space to the right of the gif and above the close button
- you can move gifs out of the "pokes" folder to prevent them from being chosen
- don't add huge gifs to the "pokes" folder if you enjoy having a functioning application

- "app.pyw" is the program
- "gameButton.py" is a class i made for buttons in a game i'm making that i decided to use for this project too. feel free to steal them, they dynamically dim the color of the button for the hover effect and the cursor changes to hand2 on hover as well.
- "animation.py" is the class i made for animating the gifs. feel free to steal this, too.

- i uploaded the first 200 pokemon in pokes, but if you want the whole hog go to my google drive folder:
